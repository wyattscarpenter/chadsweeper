# Chadsweeper

## Overview

For a lark, for a larf, I'm making a minesweeper game. I'm doing it in Pico-8 bc my teammate wanted to. This also means I get to learn lua (wow, cool (lua is just another lil imperative interpreted language inspired by C and stuff so I basically already know it (I do like how the arrays start at one, though :) (this is perhaps my most controversial opinion))).

Stage one of this project is just making a vanilla minesweeper game in pico8.

Stage 2 is adding mouse support that also moves the in-game cursor. This is possible but you have to enable some things, I hear.

Stage 3? Game design.

Stage 4, is having a novel minesweeper-based (based) game. Working title: chadsweeper.

## OK but how do I even run the project?

Good question.

I'm not sure about all the ways. But, at least, if you have pico-8 installed on your computer, then `pico8 chadsweeper.p8` in this folder will run the game. I also have p8 files associated with pico8 so I can just click on them. Wait, do those things just edit the file? You might have to hit escape and then type run and then hit enter. i guess maybe you need to run `pico8 -run chadsweeper.p8`, which I've now put in run.bat. To exit the weird little pico8 zone, issue the command "shutdown", or hit alt-f4 or ctrl-q.

TODO: I think I can't shebang this with something like `#!/bin/pico8` or `#!usr/bin/env pico8`, sadly. So you can't just run ./chadsweeper.p8 from the linux shell.

TODO: presumably I want to put this up online somewhere where people can just play it. itch.io or github.io or suchlike.
