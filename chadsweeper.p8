  //trivia: the o button character needs an emoji variation selector after it to be interpreted in pico-8 as the right character, and also to not get mangled in the pico-8 internal editor, but the x button character does not... pico-8 is so weird, because I know more about it than the very people who made it, apparently. (see also the fact that their manual is a txt but has random <br>s in it. But I'm using their thing, instead of vice-versa. Oh well. I guess it *is* a fun toy.
  //If you exclude that variation selector, then left button will be detected instead of the O. What a world!
