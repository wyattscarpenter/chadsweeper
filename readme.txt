# Chadsweeper

For a lark, for a larf, I'm making a minesweeper game. I'm doing it in Pico-8 bc my teammate wanted to. This also means I get to learn lua (wow, cool (lua is just another lil imperative interpreted language inspired by C and stuff so I basically already know it (I do like how the arrays start at one, though :) (this is perhaps my most controversial opinion))).

Stage one of this project is just making a vanilla minesweeper game in pico8.

Stage 2 is adding mouse support that also moves the in-game cursor.

Stage 3? Game design.

Stage 4, is having a novel minesweeper-based (based) game. Working title: chadsweeper.
